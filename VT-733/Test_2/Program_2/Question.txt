> Declare a double pointer in **p and allocate M*N matrix size memory to it, Where M and N are required by user at run time.

> Fill the M8N matrix data from the user input.

> Print each 3*3 Micro Block(tile) sum of elements from the above created matrix. for Example if it is 6*6 matrix, you will get 4 micro Block/ matirxes of 3*3 micro block and you have to print the sum of all sum data from the newly created sealed matrix.
For e.g if the matrix created in 2*2 matrix

8 2
3 4

it should be converted to 3* 3 matrix and the rest of the data to be appeanded is '1' as belwo. then the sum of all elements will be '22'.

8 2 1
3 4 1
1 1 1

>print the sum of both diagonals of th oringnal M*N created matirx.
