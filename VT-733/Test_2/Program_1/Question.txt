Create thereads T1, T2, T3, T4 where threads are executing the belwo:

T1 is infinitely printing '1'
T2 is infinitely printing '2'
T3 is infinitely printing '3'
T4 is infinitely printing '4'

Serialize the thread execution in a such a way that the pringing of numbers is serialized infinitely as '1','2','3','4','1','2','3','4', and so on.....

Use only sempahores inf you are writing the code in C.
