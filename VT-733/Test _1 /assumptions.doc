Assuming this code is hardcoaded for only for 10 inputs.

Also it can be made dynaic in Main function of this program by commemting and removing few commented lines in this program.




Following is the sample file how to use this program.


kharskai@vtlw040l:~/VT-733$ ./Linked_list_all_questions_VT-733 
enter the data for node[1]:1
enter the data for node[2]:2
enter the data for node[3]:3
enter the data for node[4]:4
enter the data for node[5]:5
enter the data for node[6]:6
enter the data for node[7]:7
enter the data for node[8]:8
enter the data for node[9]:9
enter the data for node[10]:10

Created Linked list is:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 

enter the position to delete:5
after deleting the node LL is as follows:
 1  2  3  4  6  7  8  9  10 
Before Swaping
enter the position from 1-10 which need to be swapped:2
9
after swaping the nodes[2] and [9] the LL is as follows:
 1  9  3  4  6  7  8  2  10
